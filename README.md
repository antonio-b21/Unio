# Unio

A Unity game designed and developed by our development team including: [Antonio Marian Bigan](https://github.com/antonio-b21), [Răzvan Alexandru Guță](https://github.com/razvanguta), [Radu Andrei Negulescu](), [Dan Gabriel Nimară](https://github.com/DanNimara), [Irina Păvălașc](https://github.com/IrinaPavalasc).

## Design and Build Tool

Unio is a multi-level platform runner game inspired by the classic video game Super Mario Bros designed using **Unity Build Tool with C#**. We created the environment, including the player, the platforms, the moving background from scratch. From the start we wanted to have collectibles, even power-ups and stats which we managed to implement.

## Agile and Trello

The game was designed using Agile practices. This can be observed from our [Product Backlog](https://trello.com/b/JcPfyhNr/product-backlog) and 3 sprints: [Sprint 1 Backlog](https://trello.com/b/TVndXXiq/sprint-1-backlog), [Sprint 1 Retrospective](https://trello.com/b/uGwjcCxv/sprint-1-retrospective), [Sprint 2 Backlog](https://trello.com/b/CnyIonQD/sprint-2-backlog), [Sprint 2 Retrospective](https://trello.com/b/AGhu4f3l/sprint-2-retrospective), [Sprint 3 Backlog](https://trello.com/b/fq0A8OOa/sprint-3-backlog), [Sprint 3 Retrospective](https://trello.com/b/eaW1u2Nm/sprint-3-retrospective). We met almost daily for a few minutes to discuss our progress during the sprints.

## Source control

For this project we didn't use GitLab or GitHub during the development process, because we had Unity's own source control system, [Unity Teams](https://unity.com/products/unity-teams). We created a team of 5 members using our institutional accounts and collaborated directly using Unity, a great plus in our book.

## Demo

A demo for this project is up on Youtube and can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arBl6MC1NsI).

## User Stories and Backlog

These can be read on our [Product Backlog](https://trello.com/b/JcPfyhNr/product-backlog). We managed to implement most of our backlog, except for Attacks and Achievements, which we keep in mind for when we'll continue to work on the game this summer. On the other hand, when we started the game we didn't expect the Camera Flow and Player Physics to be so important, so we might've added those to our backlog.


## Testing

Our testing was mostly manual, trial-and-error, but helped us discover some of the most important bugs.

## Bug Reporting

A lot of work went into the physics for the player and the camera flow, which in turn created the two bugs we found in the game during the first and the second sprints, respectively. The bugs were discovered during the QA part(our QA team for each sprint represented two different team members and Antonio Bigan had the pleasure of pulling off a double shift, having only 5 members).

## Refactoring (and coding standards)

We did refactoring for the scene transitions and respected every coding standard using C# in Unity. Moreover, we had folders for each component of our project: Background, Materials, PhysMaterials, Prefabs(for example the platform, the coin), Scenes, Scripts, etc.

## Design Patterns

Our Game Manager is a singleton.

## Conclusions

Working on this project helped us get accustomed to the Agile Software Development project and helped us maintain a close connection. :heartpulse:
